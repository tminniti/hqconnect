# hqconnect
Connects to best quality wifi connection in a network with multiple access points.
If connection drops out, or goes below a specific quality, it searches for a better one.

I just wrote it in a few hours for my OS (Xubuntu), so it's pretty specific to my 
setup. But if you have any questions or want to submit a change to make it more 
available to another Linux OS, feel free.

I wrote this up because I was at a public library that had a bunch of access points to 
the same network with the same ESSID. My computer (or dhclient i guess) would connect 
to a pretty bad one that would drop out all the time.

I'm definitely not a professional, so be nice.
